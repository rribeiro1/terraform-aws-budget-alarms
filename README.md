Terraform module that creates AWS Budgets for your resources on AWS and through the AWS Chatbot integration, enables you to receive the alerts directly into your designated Slack channel.

The module is published on [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/rribeiro1/budget-alarms)

## Features

- [x] Send budget alerts to Slack through the AWS Chatbot integration.
- [x] Set budget alerts to the AWS account as well as to specific services.
- [x] Set multiple notification thresholds for budgets.

## Configure AWS Chatbot / Slack integration

In order to configure the integration between AWS Chatbot and Slack, this module requeires the variables `slack_workspace_id` and `slack_channel_id`.

### Slack Workspace ID

You must perform the initial authorization flow with Slack in the AWS Chatbot console. Then you can copy and paste the workspace ID from the console. For more details, see steps 1-4 in [Setting Up AWS Chatbot with Slack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/setting-up.html#Setup_intro) in the AWS Chatbot User Guide.

### Slack Channel ID

Open Slack, right click on the channel name in the left pane, then choose Copy Link. The channel ID is the 9-character string at the end of the URL. For example, ABCBBLZZZ.

## Usage

A full example is contained in the [examples](/examples) directory.

```hcl
module "budget-alarms" {
  source  = "rribeiro1/budget-alarms/aws"
  version = "0.0.6"

  account_name         = "Development"
  account_budget_limit = 100.5

  services = {
    EC2 = {
      budget_limit = 50.25
    },
    S3 = {
      budget_limit = 12.35
    },
    ECR = {
      budget_limit = 10.5
    }
  }

  notifications = {
    warning = {
      comparison_operator = "GREATER_THAN"
      threshold           = 100
      threshold_type      = "PERCENTAGE"
      notification_type   = "ACTUAL"
    },
    critical = {
      comparison_operator = "GREATER_THAN"
      threshold           = 110
      threshold_type      = "PERCENTAGE"
      notification_type   = "ACTUAL"
    }
  }

  slack_workspace_id = "12345678910"
  slack_channel_id   = "12345678910"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Development"
  }
}
```

## Disable the AWS Chatbot Integration with Slack

If you don't want to create the integration between AWS Chatbot and Slack you should specify `create_slack_integration = false` as argument.

## Doc generation

Code formatting and documentation for variables and outputs are generated using [pre-commit-terraform hooks](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) which uses [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs).

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#how-to-install) to install pre-commit locally.

And install `terraform-docs` with `go get github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs` or `brew install terraform-docs`.
